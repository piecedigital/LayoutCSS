#LayoutCSS

##What is LayoutCSS?

LayoutCSS is a fairly verbose and literal CSS framework, designed to make sense semantically. LayoutCSS started off as my own personal CSS framework for quickly piecing together a website layout. I found it to be very clear and verbose so I'm releasing it now as an open-source option for those who might like that aspect of a CSS framework.

##How do I use it?

I'll be creating some documentation for it as time progresses.
